# Joint-unsupervised-and-supervised-training-for-automatic-speech-recognition-via-bilevel-optimization
we present a novel bilevel optimization training approach for ASR models that we term joint unsupervised and supervised training (JUST). JUST employs a lower-level optimization with an unsupervised loss and an upper-level optimization with a supervised loss, leveraging recent advances in penalty-based bilevel optimization.
